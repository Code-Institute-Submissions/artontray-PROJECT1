# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes

The wireframes for this website were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/sjrqfbt/peultvp).
The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured 
during the creation process. 

![Home page](assets/images/readme-images/balsamiq01.png)
![Partners](assets/images/readme-images/balsamiq02.png)
![Suscribe](assets/images/readme-images/balsamiq03.png)

## Site Structure

FOOD COST website has three pages. The [home page](https://artontray.github.io/PROJECT1/index.html) is the default loading page,
[partners](https://artontray.github.io/PROJECT1/partners.html) and [suscribe](https://artontray.github.io/PROJECT1/suscribe.html) pages are all accessible primarily 
from the up navigation menu.

[Back to top](<#contents>)

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The font chosen were 'Delius' for all the content of the website. I have chosen
      to import the font directly from the .ttf file to avoid any problem of compatibility
      in the future.
      ![Import font](assets/images/readme-images/font-delius.png)



 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme chosen is blue, purple and white.
      Blue evoke feelings of reliability and people feel more secure
      when they see the colour blue. In terms of web design, this means 
      that users may be more likely to purchase, as they view your blue website
       as reliable and professional.

# Features 

This website is intended for small or private entrepreneurs 
who works in food industry. The main page is composed by three sections :
* ## Body
   ### Navigation bar
  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes 
  links to the Logo, Home page, Partners and Suscribe page and is 
  identical in each page to allow an easy navigation.
  - This section is fixed and will allow the user to easily navigate from 
  page to page across all devices without having to revert back
   to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

![Navigation Header](assets/images/readme-images/menu-navigation.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)

   ### Middle Page


  From the beginning, i wanted to have a very flexible middle page.
  In this case , flexible means :
  - constituted by different boxes with different design.
  - easy to change the design just by selecting the right CSS class.

Box without design with title on left side :

![Middle page with left side title](assets/images/readme-images/box-design01.png)

Box with design with title on right side :

![Middle page with right side title](assets/images/readme-images/box-design02.png)

Box with design with title on center :

![Middle page with center title](assets/images/readme-images/box-design03.png)


  - middle content can have 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5 boxes in same line.

![Middle page with 5 responsive boxes](assets/images/readme-images/5-boxes-middle-page.png)

  - easy to change the design of the title of each boxes just by selecting 
  the right CSS class.
![Middle page](assets/images/readme-images/middle-page02.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)
  - and finally, easy to configure and display in different screen size. 

![Middle page on smaller screen](assets/images/readme-images/middle-page01.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)
   ### Footer
  - The footer contains social media links  and email adress.
  This section is situated in the bottom of each page and it will allow the user to comunicate with the team from anywhere in the website.
  The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

  ### Trailer
  Contains a video "trailer" :
   - I wanted to highlights the possibilities of the FOOD COST app in
  less than 1 minut.
   - The trailer is accesible directly after scrolling down the loading page. This section is 
  valuable as it encourages the user to have a dynamic view of the app's features in less than 1 minut.

## Future Features

As i wrote in the roadmap, my goal would be to develop the app 
entirely. 

**As a first goal** :
- Create an log in section
- Create a database where users can add ingredients list with prices 
- Create a nice template for recipes
- Display a recipe book with one click.

**As a final goal** :
- Create a marketplace where you could share/sell/exchange your best recipes.
- Give the possibility to add a new recipe in the database just by taking a picture
of an hand written recipe and all items auto-detected and then generate
a food cost price and digital recipe. Very ambitious!

# Testing

## Am I responsive Website?
Yes, I am!
- The responsive design tests were carried out on Iphones, Samsung Galaxy S8+, Ipad Air and Surface Pro 7 with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and also on [Responsive design checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

- Responsive test from https://ui.dev/amiresponsive :

![index.html](assets/images/readme-images/html-checker-index.png)
- partners.html :
![partners.html](assets/images/readme-images/html-checker-partners.png)

![suscribe.html](assets/images/readme-images/html-checker-suscribe.png)

[Back to top](<#contents>)

  [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
  No errors or warnings shows up as the picture below shows :

[Back to top](<#contents>)
## Browser Compatibility

The website was tested on the following browsers with no visible issues for the user :
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari

Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers.

[Back to top](<#contents>)

## Lighthouse
The site was also tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) 
in Chrome Developer Tools to test each of the pages for:
* Performance - How the page performs while loading.
* Accessibility - Is the site acccessible for all users and how can it be improved.
* Best Practices - Site conforms to industry best practices.
* SEO - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

My first try was surprising : Very slow to load
![Bad perf.](assets/images/readme-images/bad-perf.png)

This part of the testing process showed up that the site was slow to load, mainly due to 
the image sizes and video trailer. All the images/videos needed to be compressed before adding to the repository.

### Bugs

## Fixed Bug

  - The Layout in smaller screen as Iphone SE shows some issues with the box shadow.

  ![Bad layout on smaller screens](assets/images/readme-images/bug-fixed01.png)
  
  I fixed it easily by take away the shadow effect : `box-shadow: none;` into `style.css file`.

  ![Much better layout for smaller screens](assets/images/readme-images/bug-fixed02.png)

  - The website site has been tested through the 
  [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
  Some Warnings shows up at the beginning but easily fixed.

  ![Warning HTML](assets/images/readme-images/warning-html.png)
  ![Warning HTML](assets/images/readme-images/warning-html02.png)

## Unfixed Bug

The trailer shows up really small in small devices like Iphone 5. I would like to 
add a possibility to put full screen display but it seems I need Javascript
to fix that. [Check this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27768320/html5-video-double-click-to-go-full-screen)
